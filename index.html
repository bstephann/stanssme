  <h1>Assignment1</h1>
  
  <p>An example of software that I personally think is designed very well is Google Maps. I often use Google Maps to show 
  me places i can go to nearby and how I can get there, but it also displays nearby restaurants, businesses, and stores. 
  This software design has several perks, such as showing me the various transportation options, including bike, car, 
  walking, and public transit. The design intricately allows the user to know exactly where to go. For instance, when 
  I need to take the bus to a city, Google Maps would show me which bus to take, the pickup and drop-off times, as well 
  as my estimated arrival time, which is very useful for ensuring I'm not late to an appointment or meeting.This software 
  was designed attentively to ensure users can find all the information they need within the app, rather than having to 
  search the internet for more details. Overall the simplicity, efficiency, accessibility and ease of use is what made this 
  software very useful to users and what sets it apart.This is why personally think Google Maps is very well-designed and 
  meets the needs of its users.</p> 
  
  </p>I believe software design is very important and critical step to brainstorm and talk about before finalizing the product. 
  Due to the technological advancements, it is essential to thoroughly research the existing market to ensure there isint any overlap and 
  that you are making distinct software that provides the needs,wants and preferences to users. Carefully executing the software is 
  important to not only meet the needs of users, but to offer new possibilities, outcomes ways that people can use your product. 
  But design also helps ensure the performance, quality and reliability of the product, which is why i believe software design is 
  very important to learn and to instill in your softwares.</p>

    <h2>Assignment2</h2>
    
  <p>1.Write a short paragraph (up to 200 words) to summarize what is happening in the requirements gathering stage and 
  explain why this stage is important for the entire software development process.</p>

  <p>Requirement gathering is a critical first step in the software development process, as it involves thoroughly understanding 
  the user's wants, needs, and constraints. This stage is essential for defining the functions and desired outputs of the 
  software product. Without clear and comprehensive requirements gathering, it is impossible to create a product that truly meets 
  the user's objectives. The requirement gathering phase sets the foundation for all subsequent stages of the software development 
  lifecycle. It is crucial to ensure that the requirements are clear, concise, measurable, prioritized, traceable, and testable. 
  This enables the development team to design and build a software product that is of high quality, useful, and aligned with the client's 
  needs. Careful consideration of all possibilities and close collaboration with the stakeholders during the requirement gathering stage can 
  help prevent common issues such as project delays, increased costs, and cause many more inconveniences. By deeply understanding the problem being solved and 
  the client's desired outcomes, the development team can create a product that not only satisfies the client but also delivers a high level 
  of quality and usability. Ultimately, the requirement gathering phase is the cornerstone of the software development process, as it lays the 
  foundation for a successful project outcome.</p>

 
<p></p>2. Assume you were asked to develop the software product you talked about in.Writing Assignment 1 (Note: In Writing Assignment 1 you were asked 
to give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was designed well and explain why). Write 5 user stories for that software. 
(Recall the user story template: As a <user type>, I want <some action/function>, so that <some reason>. </p>

1.As a customer, I want to be able to easily search up how where my destination is, so that I can know what way to take <br>
2.As a customer, I want to be able to view multiple route options, so that I can take the route that's the most convenient for me <br>
